# brainTumorDetection
# Description 
Welcome to our project! This is a Brain Tumor Detection system made in Python using  flask . It allows users to add MRI images of the brain and detect Tumor 
It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)  a type of deep learning neural network architecture that is commonly used in computer vision to recognize the pattern
in the image data to extract features from the input image.
